Infrastructure as Code, also known as IaC, is a way of providing a flexible and automated way to manage and deploy cloud infrastructure. In the past, when developing an application or service, teams needed to manually provision, configure, and manage the underlying infrastructure. This process was both labour-intensive and prone to human errors, making it difficult to keep up with the demand of rapid deployments.

In today’s world, Infrastructure as Code has revolutionized the way teams deploy and manage their infrastructure. By coding a declarative set of instructions, teams can automate the entire process of building, configuring, and managing cloud infrastructures. This eliminates manual errors and increases scalability.

## What is Infrastructure as Code?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process by which a set of instructions is written in code that can be used to automatically provision, configure, and manage cloud infrastructure. This code is written in a declarative model, meaning that the code tells the system what the system should be like, rather than how the system is to be created. IaC is used to automate all components of DevOps, including cloud infrastructure, server setup, deployment pipelines, configuration management, and more.

## Benefits of Infrastructure as Code

There are several benefits to automating infrastructure with Infrastructure as Code:

- **Increase Efficiency:** Automation eliminates manual labor, ensuring that all steps of the process are repeated accurately and quickly. This reduces human errors and increases system scalability.

- **Flexibility:** IaC allows for software, applications, and entire infrastructures to be quickly modified and redeployed. This gives teams the freedom to focus on innovation rather than manual tasks.

- **Reliability:** Automation also enables simplified code updates and reduces the risk of human error. This leads to more reliable and secure infrastructure.

- **Cost Savings:** Automating the process eliminates the need for expensive consultants and manual labor, leading to cost savings.

## Implementing Infrastructure as Code

So, now that we know the benefits of Infrastructure as Code, let’s look at how to implement it for our own infrastructure. We’ll use Terraform to set up our infrastructure on AWS. 

### Step 1: Install Terraform

Before we can use Terraform, we’ll need to install it. Terraform is an open-source tool that can be used to automate the deployment of infrastructure. You can download Terraform from [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

### Step 2: Write a script

After Terraform is installed, we need to write a script to tell Terraform what our desired infrastructure should look like. This script is typically written in the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) and stored in a file with a `.tf` extension. 

A basic Terraform script is as follows:

```
provider "aws" {
  access_key = "your_access_key"
  secret_key = "your_secret_key"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

In this example, we’re creating an AWS instance using the specified AMI and t2.micro instance type. You can find more details on writing Terraform scripts [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html).

### Step 3: Execute the script

Finally, we’ll need to execute the script to create our actual infrastructure. To do this, we’ll use the `terraform apply` command. This command will read your script, provision the appropriate infrastructure, and output a set of resources that were created. 

For example, if you run the script above, you may get an output like this: 

```
aws_instance.example: Creation complete after 0s (ID: i-0e2a2a4da2019cfd)
```

## Conclusion

Infrastructure as Code provides an automated way to deploy and manage cloud infrastructure with ease. By writing a script in a declarative model, teams can rapidly build, configure, and manage their infrastructure. This eliminates manual labor and increases reliability, scalability, and cost savings. Try out Infrastructure as Code today and you won’t regret it!
