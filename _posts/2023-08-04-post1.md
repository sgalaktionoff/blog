Python is a powerful and versatile language, popular amongst many developers or programmers, professional or amateur alike. Its syntax is relatively easy to understand and follow, making Python a favorite for many who value quick development. While with plain Python you can build a lot of different applications, some libraries and frameworks can help speed up the process and help to create even more robust and polished applications. Here we will explore the 5 essential Python libraries for creating modern applications.


## Requests 
[Requests](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/) is a Python library for making any type of HTTP request easier and faster. Whether you want to do a simple GET or POST request to an API or do complex forms or include authentication, Requests can handle it all. 

The following example shows how simple it is to make an HTTP request with Requests. 

```python
import requests

res = requests.get('https://example.org/api/endpoint')
print(res.status_code) # 200
```

## Pytest
[Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) is one of the leading Python testing frameworks and is popularly used in many Python projects. It is highly versatile, enabling developers to use it for both unit and integration testing in their projects. It also makes it easy to create and manage test cases, and debug and fix broken code.

The following example shows how to use pytest to run a test suite:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def my_fixture():
    return "fixture"

def test_something(my_fixture):
    assert my_fixture == "fixture"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    pytest.main([__file__])
```

## Django
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a popular web framework built on Python that enables developers to create complex web applications quickly and easily. It handles a lot of the heavy lifting of setting up and managing the web application, allowing developers to focus on the more task-relevant parts of the code. 

The following example shows how to use Django to create a basic web application:

```python
# myproject/urls.py
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]

# myproject/views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello World!")
```

## NumPy
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is a powerful library for scientific computing with Python. It enables developers to create and manipulate multi-dimensional arrays and matrices with ease. It also contains powerful functions for linear algebra, numerical integration, and for dealing with data in various formats.

The following example shows how to use NumPy for creating and manipulating multi-dimensional arrays:

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1,2,2],
                [3,4,5],
                [6,7,8])

print(arr.shape) # (3, 3)
```

## Matplotlib
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a popular graphing library in Python that enables developers to create publication-quality graphs and visuals quickly and easily. It is used broadly in data science, machine learning, and other scientific applications.

The following example shows how to use Matplotlib to create a simple line graph:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.arange(0, 10, 0.1)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

These five essential Python libraries are great tools for creating modern applications with Python. Using these libraries, developers can quickly build powerful and sophisticated applications with Python that scale well and are easy to maintain.
