 Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) is a cloud-based, modernized analytics platform that enables businesses to quickly and easily build, deploy and manage high-quality, predictive models with ease. Its powerful capabilities enable businesses to gain insights from their data, transforming how they operate, how they anticipate customer needs and how they capitalize on new opportunities.

This guide walks through Azure ML’s step-by-step process for creating predictive models. From data preparation to feature engineering, to model selection and deployment, learn how Azure ML makes it easy to apply predictive analytics to your business problem.

## Step 1: Connect to Your Data Source 

The first step in creating predictive models with Azure ML is to connect your data to the platform. Azure ML supports a variety of data sources, including local flat files, streaming data, database tables, or even data from third-party sources such as Salesforce.

Once you’ve selected a data source, the Azure ML platform makes it easy to bring your data into the development environment. To do this, simply use the“Project” tab in the left pane and then select the “Connect to Data” option. From there, you can easily connect to your source and start using the data within your predictive model-building workflows. 

## Step 2: Data Preparation and Cleaning 

Once your data is connected, it’s time to begin the cleaning and preparation process. This is an important step in the model-building process and will help ensure that your model is as accurate as possible. 

Data preparation and cleaning include tasks like transforming, enriching, and normalizing your datasets to ensure that the features you use to train the model are optimally represented within the data. Depending on the needs of your application and your analysis goals, this could involve a variety of tasks such as filtering, imputation of missing values, conversion of categorical data to numerical values, or the removal of outliers.

For example, you may want to normalize your data (i.e. make sure all feature values are on the same scale) before creating a model. You can do this using Azure ML's tools like "Normalize Data" and "Normalize Data by Group" to create new columns that are normalized relative to a given input.

## Step 3: Feature Engineering 

The next step in the model-building process is feature engineering. This means creating new features, or variables, based on the values of existing features. Feature engineering is essential for developing accurate models, as it allows you to identify and exploit new patterns and connections in your data that you may not have discovered otherwise. 

Azure ML makes it easy to perform feature engineering, either through transforming existing features using in-built functions, or by creating new features from existing ones. 

For instance, you may want to aggregate values across multiple datasets in order to create a new feature. With Azure ML, you can use the Join and Group By tool to aggregate values across multiple columns from different datasets. Alternatively, you can split existing datasets into subgroups using the "Split Data" tool or run multiple algorithms on a dataset using the "Model" tool.

You can also use these feature engineering techniques to transform datasets in other ways, such as converting categorical data to numerical values or extracting variables from text columns. In addition, you may also want to remove columns entirely if they’re not predictive of your desired outcome. 

By completing the feature engineering process, you’ll have identified all the key variables in your dataset that you need in order to start the actual model-building process.

## Step 4: Model Selection

After completing the data preparation and feature engineering processes, you’re ready to start selecting the best model for your predictive task. This is a very important step because the model you end up using will directly affect the accuracy of your predictions and the utility of the model. 

Azure ML allows you to compare and select from a variety of models including popular machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, Naive Bayes, and random forests), as well as specialized steps such as boosting, cross-validation, and feature selection. 

To choose the right model for the job, Azure ML provides several tools so you can compare the accuracy and performance of various models. Some of these tools, like the “Train Model” tool, allow you to manually tweak various parameters to identify which model works best for your task. 

The platform also provides an automated means of model selection through something known as the Automatic Machine Learning (Auto ML) module. This module takes your data and automatically searches for the best model to address your predictive task.

## Step 5: Deployment and Scoring 

Once you’ve identified the best model for your predictive task, it’s time to deploy and score the model. This step involves deploying the model in production, either on-premise or in the cloud, and running it to generate predictions. 

Azure ML provides simple deployment options, allowing you to deploy your model for production using the “Deploy Model” tool. This tool allows you to easily create a web service, deploy the model, and scale as needed. 

Once you’ve deployed the model and connected it to a web service, you can start scoring it to generate predictions. Azure ML provides a variety of tools to score your model. For example, the “Predict Model” tool allows you to generate predictions on a dataset and the “Batch Predict” tool allows you to generate predictions for a large number of records at once. 

# Conclusion

Creating predictive models with Azure ML is a straightforward process. From connecting to your data source and preparing it for model-building, to feature engineering and model selection, to deployment and scoring the model for predictions, Azure ML makes it easy to build high-quality predictive models with minimal effort.

By following the steps outlined in this guide, you’ll have a better understanding of the process involved in creating models with Azure Machine Learning and you can start exploiting the potential of predictive analytics in your business immediately.
