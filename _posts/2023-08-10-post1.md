Google holds the lion’s share of search engine traffic and usage, and it’s for good reason. Google is powerful, easy to use, and packed with features that can help you achieve more from your searches. To get the most out of your Google searches, though, you need to know which features to use and how to use them efficiently. Below are five hidden tricks to unlock the power of Google Search.

## 1. Search Selectively
Sometimes, the amount of information accessed through a simple search can be overwhelming. To narrow your results, try using the plus (+) sign to search for words that must appear in the result. For example, by searching for +cucumber +pickles, Google will include only web pages that contain both “cucumber” and “pickles.” You can also use the - sign to exclude items from your search. For instance, -apple will only show you results that don’t have “apple” in them.

## 2. Search for Specific Types of Content
Google has a number of search parameters that allow you to refine your results by the type of content you’re looking for. For example, typing in filetype:pdf will only show PDFs that relate to your query. You can also use other parameter operators to search for videos, images, or even books.

## 3. Use Google’s Advanced Search Page
Google’s Advanced Search page (https://www.google.com/advanced_search) provides a more in-depth way to refine your search results. Here, you can specify a website or domain to search from, filter results by language or time, and more. You can even search based on related words or phrases, or restrict your results to or exclude documents with particular words or phrases. 

## 4. Search for Exact Phrases
Adding quotation marks “ ” around a phrase will ensure that Google only returns results that contain that exact phrase, not results that simply include the same words. For example, “Google Search” will return documents that precisely contain the phrase “Google Search”, whereas searching for the same words without quotation marks will return pages with just a mix of “Google” and “Search”. 

## 5. Search Within a Site
Sometimes you’re only interested in the content a particular website has to offer. To search a specific domain or website, use what’s called a site search, which can be formatted as `site:www.example.com "fred"`. This will give you content only from www.example.com that contains the word “fred.” This is great if you’re looking for something specific or only want to see results from a reliable source. 

Google is an amazingly powerful tool, and its hidden tricks can give you reliable and relevant content quickly and easily. We hope these five hidden tricks help you unlock the power of Google search and increase your productivity. Happy searching!
