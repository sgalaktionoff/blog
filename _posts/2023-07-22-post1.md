# Exploring the Future of Linux: Predictions on What's Next in the Cloud-Native World

Linux has been around for more than two decades and is constantly evolving. In recent years, it has become an increasingly important platform for cloud-native technologies, and its influence is only likely to grow. Here, weâ€™ll explore some of the ways that Linux will likely impact the world of cloud-native technologies in the coming years.

## Automation and Orchestration

Automation and orchestration are two important components of any cloud-native approach. They allow for the automated deployment and management of applications and services across a variety of cloud environments. This automation can reduce the cost, time, and complexity of managing services in the cloud.

These two concepts are becoming increasingly important as more companies move to the cloud. As part of this shift, Linux is playing an increasingly important role in the automation and orchestration of cloud applications. This is because Linux is an open source platform, meaning it is easy to customize and tailor for specific use cases.

For example, tools like Kubernetes and Ansible are both built on top of Linux and allow for automated deployment and management of applications in the cloud. These tools are becoming more and more popular and will likely continue to play an important role in cloud-native technologies.

## DevOps and Continuous Delivery

The concept of DevOps is closely intertwined with the cloud-native world. DevOps is the practice of integrating development, operations, and deployment into a single workflow. This workflow is designed to reduce the time and effort needed to deploy and manage applications and services in the cloud.

Linux is a key component of this workflow, as it provides the necessary infrastructure to enable DevOps. Additionally, Linux also provides the necessary tools for continuous delivery, which is the practice of delivering software on a continuous basis.

Tools like Docker and Ansible are both built on top of Linux and allow for automated deployment and management in the cloud. This automation helps to ensure that applications are constantly up-to-date and running smoothly.


Security is always a major concern in cloud-native technologies, and Linux can play an important role here. Linux kernels can be heavily customized and tailored to fit specific use cases. This allows them to be configured for greater security, as well as providing an additional layer of defense against potential security threats.

Additionally, many cloud-native technologies rely on Linux containers to isolate applications and services from one another. This isolation helps to reduce the risk of a security breach, as malicious code or data can not easily be passed between applications.

Finally, Linux is also becoming increasingly important for the monitoring and management of cloud-native applications and services. For example, tools like ELK are becoming increasingly popular for monitoring and security purposes, and are built on top of Linux.

## Conclusion

Linux is an increasingly important platform for cloud-native technologies, and its impact is only likely to grow in the future. Its open source nature makes it highly customizable and tailor-able to fit specific use cases, and tools like Kubernetes, Ansible, and Docker are all built on top of Linux. It also provides additional layers of security for cloud applications and services, as well as the necessary infrastructure for DevOps and continuous delivery.

Overall, Linux is an important part of the cloud-native world and its influence is only likely to grow in the coming years. As cloud-native technologies continue to evolve, Linux will play an ever-important role in enabling, managing, and securing these services and applications.
