Since its launch in 2015, Windows 10 has become the most popular Windows operating system. Microsoft has worked hard to make Windows 10 the best Windows experience yet. From faster performance to improved security, Windows 10 has a lot to offer desktop users. In this blog post, we'll explore some of the latest features available in Windows 10 for desktops.

## The Start Menu
The most significant change to Windows 10 is the Start Menu. It combines elements of the traditional Start Menu and the Start Screen from Windows 8. You can customize the look and feel of the Start Menu, giving you quick access to the apps and programs you use every day. Additionally, you can also use Cortana to search for applications, files, and settings directly from the Start Menu.

## Windows Hello
Windows Hello is a novel authentication system that lets you log in to Windows 10 using facial recognition, fingerprint recognition, or even an iris scanner. It's a secure and convenient way to protect your data and take full advantage of Windows 10's features.

## Virtual Desktops
One of the most useful Windows 10 features is the virtual desktop system. This allows you to split your screen into multiple 'workspaces', allowing you to switch between different tasks and focus on one without getting distracted by the others.

## Tablet Mode
Tablet mode is another great Windows 10 feature that allows you to take full advantage of the touch-screen capabilities of your device. When enabled, Tablet Mode allows you to access apps directly from the Start Screen and provides touch-friendly menus and controls for easy navigation.

## File Explorer
File Explorer is one of the most essential components of Windows 10. It allows you to quickly browse and manage your files and folders. The latest version of File Explorer has been updated with a modern interface, making it much easier to navigate. You can also take advantage of the search bar and bookmarks to quickly find the files you need.

## Improved Taskbar
The Windows 10 taskbar has been redesigned to provide greater flexibility for users. You can customize the layout to quickly access applications, as well as pin programs, documents, and links for easy access. Additionally, you can also use the taskbar to manage quick settings such as volume and network settings.

## Windows Subsystem for Linux
The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) allows users to run Linux distributions directly on Windows 10. This is a great way to use Linux applications on your Windows 10 desktop. It's also a great tool for developers, allowing them to easily switch between different environments and compilers.

## Conclusion
Windows 10 has a great range of features for desktops, allowing users to work more productively and securely. The addition of features such as the Start Menu, Windows Hello, Virtual Desktops, Tablet Mode, and the improved File Explorer make it even easier to take full advantage of Windows 10's capabilities. With more features and improvements being made all the time, it's no wonder that Windows 10 is the most popular Windows operating system.
