Inspired by the urgency of a post-COVID world, CIOs (Chief Information Officers) are once again at the forefront as powerful agents of change. The past year has seen a huge surge in technological disruption, forcing business leaders to rethink their strategies and transition into a more digital-dependent model. Consequently, the calls for a digital transformation have become louder and clearer. Digital transformation strategies can be crucial for businesses looking to stay competitive and thrive in a post-pandemic world. Ahead lies an opportunity for the CIOs to lead the pack by becoming the architects of digital transformation.

# The Imperativeness of Digital Transformation

We already know that digital transformation has been gaining more and more attention as businesses are increasingly harnessing the power of technologies such as cloud computing, big data, Machine Learning and AI. It is seen as an essential tool for streamlining and optimizing operations, boosting customer engagement and revenue, as well as optimizing business processes for cost and performance.

However, what has made digital transformation even more pertinent for today’s organizations is the radical changes brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. Enterprises have suffered the consequences of the financial fallout, reduced operations, furloughs, and widespread remote work. It has become essential for combat the challenges of such an uncertain environment and seek out growth opportunities in order to survive. Digital technologies have become their only safeguard, allowing them to manage risk factors and stay agile.

# CIOs as Drivers of Digital Transformation

With an exposure to disruptive technologies, the role of the CIO is changing in response to rising demand for better using digital technologies as a strategic business enabler. By understanding the opportunities presented by digital transformation, the CIO can become the key player in helping organizations comprehend their current state, and pave out the route for their digital journey.

Thus, CIOs have a unique imperative to assess their IT complexity and technology landscape, to determine their current capabilities and understand the tools and strategies available for achieving digital transformation. The CIO should keep an open, interdisciplinary mindset and work hand in hand with business executives in order to further develop the strategies that will effectively make use of digital technologies for maximum profits.

# Mapping Out the Digital Transformation Roadmap

To enable digital transformation, the CIO must start by understanding the essence of digital transformation. It isn’t about replacing existing systems and processes, but about reinventing them so that they are in line with the digital world. A separate line of thought must be created to redefine the strategies that meet new customer needs, operate using new technologies, and compete in new ways. As such, mapping out a roadmap that charts the digital journey ahead is essential for success.

When creating a digital roadmap, CIOs should take into consideration the current trends such as direct access to analytics, adoption of DevOps to ensure deployment, Hybrid Cloud integration for better scalability, Cybersecurity protocols to safeguard data, Automation and AI to simplify workflows, among others. **A number of key considerations should also be taken to identify the most important areas to tackle.

## Identifying the Right Vision

The blueprint of the roadmap should have a well articulated vision with a deep focus on the customer. It is essential to have a deep understanding as to why customers choose a particular product or service, and why customers come back or go away. The digital transformation journey should thus revolve around understanding customer behaviour in a way that leads to better customer engagement and retention, as well as paving the way for new opportunities.

## Realizing the goals for securing the success (MVP)

It is essential to determine the minimum viable product (MVP) which is an initial version of the product with minimal features that is used to gauge the success of the product in the market. The MVP should be defined first as it sets the pace for the whole roadmap, taking into account the expected return on investment and the key user functions that need to be there for the success of the product.

## Gathering the Right Metrics

Digital transformation strategies should incorporate metrics that truly reflect the success of the product, taking into account customer lifecycle experience, cost analysis, user engagement, market data, brand visibility, lead generation, visibility and discoverability of content, as well as user feedback and analytics. Tracking the right metrics over time is essential to managing the progress and making informed decisions.

## Harnessing Change-Welcoming Technologies

The right set of technologies must be used to unlock the potential of digital transformation, from automation to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Cloud Computing. A clear strategy must be put in place to level your organization up with the latest technologies.
	
# Transitioning Employees Across the Digital Transformation Journey

It is critical to ensure effective human support during the transition to a digital-driven model. Employees must be provided with the right skills and be encouraged to be creative with their ideas in order to keep up with the volatile evolutions in the business landscape. For the in-house transformation, leadership functions and cross-functional training is essential. In terms of external support, Managed Services and Consulting Partnerships can also prove to be of great help to staff the right skills and ensure successful implementation.

# Final Thoughts

With these key steps in place, CIOs can confidently execute the optimal digital transformation strategies and lead their entire organization into the offering an upgraded, digital-first version of themselves in a post-pandemic world. To succeed, the CIO must demonstrate the basic level of tech-savvy and be ahead of the curve in terms of the latest digital trends. Keeping up with the changes and calling shots as they arise would prove to be their greatest USP as someone leading the transformational era.

In conclusion, Digital transformation promises efficiency, scalability, opportunity for cost-effectiveness and ease of operations which will certainly help organizations in the current competitive market. CIOs have to up their game and set the tone for the entire digital transformation journey, leading with technology-focused action points and customer-driven insights.
