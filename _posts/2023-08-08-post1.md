In today’s world, IT infrastructure is constantly evolving to address the demands of the modern digital enterprise. To keep up with this ever-changing landscape, organizations must look for new ways to deploy, automate, manage, and secure their IT environments in order to remain competitive. One of the most powerful tools for achieving these goals is VMware’s suite of virtualization solutions.

For those unfamiliar, VMware offers solutions like software-defined data centers, which enable organizations to efficiently manage clouds, network and storage, as well as automation and orchestration tools that allow IT teams to quickly configure and deploy environments. This kind of setup provides organizations with unprecedented flexibility and scalability, allowing them to rapidly meet the needs of their customers or users -- without the need for large capital investments in hardware or disruptive changes to existing systems.

At the same time, VMware also provides powerful security solutions that can protect organizations across their physical, virtual, and cloud infrastructure. With VMware's solutions, organizations can identify and mitigate risks, as well as automate infrastructure security with continuous vigilance. This helps organizations ensure that their systems remain secure while still providing the flexibility and scalability to let the business grow.

To further increase the benefits of the VMware suite, many organizations have found ways to leverage the platform to achieve dramatically improved performance. Many of these improvements come from advanced automation and orchestration tools, which are able to automatically run routine tasks and quickly alter network settings to adjust resources for peak performance. With the right setup, organizations can take advantage of the scalability of the platform and quickly provision additional resources when needed, allowing applications to run faster and more efficiently.

Finally, it should also be noted that VMware's wide variety of offerings allow organizations to maximize the use of public clouds. By combining the flexibility of an on-premise VMware environment with existing cloud services, organizations can build a hybrid cloud environment that can be used to meet the needs of their users. With the right setup, they can easily move workloads between on-premises and cloud environments, providing them with added flexibility to meet changing needs.

In conclusion, VMware's suite of offerings can be a powerful tool for modern organizations who are looking to get the most out of their IT infrastructure. With the right setup, organizations can benefit from improved agility, scalability, and security, as well as the cost savings associated with public cloud utilization. By leveraging VMware's solutions properly, organizations can ensure that their infrastructure is ready for whatever the digital age may bring.

```python
import boto3

# Create a session 
session = boto3.Session()

# Create a base VM using Amazon EC2 
ec2_client = session.client('ec2')

# Specify the image to use 
image_ami = 'ami-abc1234'

# Create a new instance 
instance_response = ec2_client.run_instances(ImageId=image_ami,
                                            InstanceType='t2.small')

# Get the instance ID 
instance_id = instance_response['Instances'][0]['InstanceId']

# Create the VMWare instance 
vmware_client = session.client('vmware') 

# Ensure it is hosted in the appropriate region 
region = 'us-east-1'

# Create the virtual machine
create_vm_response = vmware_client.create_vm(NAME, regionId=region, instance_id= instance_id)

if create_vm_response['status'] == 'success':
  print('VM successfully created')
  else:
    print('There was an issue creating the VM')
```
