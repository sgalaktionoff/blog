DevOps is short for “development operations” which is a term used to describe a philosophy of collaboration between developers and operations teams. Adopting a DevOps workflow requires the combination of continuous integration, continuous deployment and the automation of processes. This combined set of tools brings about the delivery of stable, tested software in a fast and secure manner.

The purpose of this beginner’s guide is to provide a basic understanding of how to get started with modern DevOps on Unix. We’ll cover the fundamentals including tools and techniques, and recommend resources for further learning. 

## Introducing DevOps

DevOps began as a way of streamlining the communication and collaboration between developers and operations personals. It increases the overall efficiency of software delivery, streamlines productivity, automates certain parts of the process, and fosters communication between different teams who are working on a common project. 

A DevOps workflow integrates development, QA & testing, and operations teams into one holistic process. This results in faster software delivery with decreased risks and costs. This is in stark contrast to traditional legacy processes, which can be slow and inefficient.

## Understanding DevOps Tools and Techniques

DevOps requires the use of various tools and techniques in order to be successful. Currently, the most popular and widely used DevOps tools include automation tools, configuration management, and continuous integration and delivery systems. 

### Automation Tools

Automation tools allow administrators to automate repetitive tasks in order to save both time and resources. Examples of automation tools include Puppet, Chef, Salt and Ansible. These tools allow administrators to automate deployment into multiple environments, reduce manual labor through the automation of common tasks, and help ensure all machines in the system remain consistent. 

### Configuration Management

Configuration management is the process of making sure that the environment in which the code is running is always consistent. This is important for deploying code into various environments, and for maintaining the same environment across multiple machines. 

Examples of configuration management tools include Puppet and Chef, which are both capable of keeping track of the configuration of machines in a network. Configuration management tools can also create virtual machines with the same configuration in order to replicate production environments. 

### Continuous Integration and Delivery

Continuous integration (CI) allows developers to integrate their work into a version control system, such as Git, at regular intervals throughout the development project. This allows developers to ensure that their code is always in a stable state and to promptly detect any issues that may arise.

Continuous delivery (CD) is the process of releasing software in regularly scheduled intervals, such as on a daily or weekly basis. It is based on the idea that frequent, small releases are more reliable and easier to manage than infrequent, large ones. This approach allows the team to identify bugs and other issues quickly and makes it easier to ensure that the software remains stable.

## Setting Up the Environment

Now that you’re familiar with the basics, the next step is to set up the environment for deploying and managing your code. This step involves downloading the necessary tools, creating users, and creating directories.

### Downloading the Tools

The first step is to download the DevOps tools required for your project. Some of the most popular DevOps tools that are available for Unix include Chef, Puppet, and Ansible.

Once a tool is downloaded, it will need to be installed. Most DevOps tools are available in Unix-based packages, which can be installed using a package manager such as apt-get. For example, you can install Chef on a Ubuntu system by typing `sudo apt-get install chef` into the terminal. 

### Creating Users

You will also need to create users who will manage the code. These users should be given access to the necessary tools so that they can carry out their tasks. 

Create a group, such as ‘devops’, and give it read/write/execute permissions on the tools. This way, a single user can be used to manage the code. To create a user, use the command `useradd’.

### Creating Directories

The final step is to create directories where the code will be stored and the projects will be organized. Each project should have its own directory. This allows for better organization and makes it easier to keep track of the different components of the project.

Each project should also have a ‘data’ directory where configuration files and other data will be stored. This is essential for versioning and allows users to roll back to a previous version of the project if they run into any problems or issues.

# Conclusion 

Getting started with modern DevOps on Unix can be daunting, but it is worth the effort. With the right tools, techniques, and a bit of work, modern DevOps on Unix can help drive innovation and provide a platform for faster, more secure software delivery. 

Hopefully, this guide has provided enough information to jump start your understanding of DevOps and help you get setup with a environment that aligns with modern DevOps workflow. For further learning, we highly advise going through the FAQsand  repositories, such as Github, so you can get an in-depth understanding of the tools available and adopt the best DevOps workflow for your projects.
