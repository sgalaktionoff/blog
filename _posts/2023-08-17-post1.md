R is a powerful open-source programming language and platform designed for data analysis and statistical computing. It has recently gained in popularity and more and more people are looking to learn and use it for their projects. This introduction is intended to provide primarily a practical starting point for those wanting to get their feet wet in the R programming language.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with R programming, the following programs should already be installed on your computer:
* An R software package as found at https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/ 
* An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as RStudio (recommended) or Jupyter

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of the R language can be demonstrated using a simple line of code:

```r
print("Hello, world!")
```

This code displays the string "Hello, world!" when executed. To run this code, open up your preferred IDE and write the code into the console. Pressing enter should display the message printed out.

## Operators

The R language has a set of built-in operators that will come in handy in everyday programming. These operators allow you to manipulate data and create expressions. 

The following example demonstrates how to add two numeric values together:

```r
a <- 2
b <- 4

c <- a + b

print(c)
```

The result of this code should be 6. To test this code for yourself, copy it into your IDE and press enter. 

## Variables 

Variables are used to store data that can be retrieved and manipulated later on. Creating and naming variables is an essential part of programming in R.

The following code shows the syntax for creating variables and assigning them values:

```r
name <- "John"
age <- 20

print(name)
print(age)
```

The output of this code should be the name and age that were assigned. Try running this code in your IDE to verify the result.

## Comments

Comments can be added into your code to help describe and explain what you are doing. Comments do not affect code execution and can often be very useful in debugging and organization.

Comments always start with a `#` sign and the rest of the line is ignored. For example:

```r
# This is a comment
a <- 2
b <- 4
c <- a + b # This is another comment

print(c)
```

## Data Types

Data in R is stored in specific data types. Knowing which data type to use for specific tasks is key to efficient programming. The common data types are:

* `numeric` for numeric values
* `character` for text data
* `logical` for TRUE/FALSE values 

The following code shows how to create variables of different data types and display their corresponding values:

```r
x <- 15    # numeric
name <- "John"  # character
logical <- TRUE  # logical

print(x)
print(name)
print(logical)
```

The result of this code should be 15, John, and TRUE. Try running this code in your IDE to check the result. 

## Conclusion

This brief introduction hopefully provides enough of a foundation to get started with the basics of the R programming language. To learn more about what R can do, reading the official documentation or taking an online course are excellent ways to extend your knowledge. Good luck!
