Windows Server 2019 has been a reliable and robust operating system for organizations of all sizes. However, with the release of Windows Server 2022, Microsoft has introduced several compelling features and improvements that make upgrading a highly desirable option. In this blog post, we will explore the reasons why users should consider upgrading from Windows Server 2019 to Windows Server 2022.

## Enhanced Security and Compliance

In today's digital landscape, security and compliance are of utmost importance. Windows Server 2022 offers enhanced security features that address modern-day threats and help organizations meet their compliance requirements.

### Secure Core Server

Windows Server 2022 introduces Secure Core Server, a new deployment option that provides enhanced security and protects against advanced attacks. Secure Core Server employs hardware-rooted security technologies, such as Secure Boot, System Guard, and Virtualization-Based Security, to establish a trusted platform for running critical workloads. Upgrading to Windows Server 2022 will provide organizations with an added layer of protection against sophisticated threats.

### Secured-core for Hybrid Cloud

Windows Server 2022 also extends the Secured-core concept to hybrid cloud deployments. By integrating with Azure Arc, organizations can leverage Azure Security Center to monitor and manage the security posture of their Windows Server instances across on-premises, multi-cloud, and edge environments. This comprehensive security approach ensures consistent protection and reduces the attack surface for your critical workloads.

### Containerization and Zero Trust

Windows Server 2022 strengthens its support for containerization and Zero Trust security models. The new version includes improvements to Windows Server containers, such as the ability to run Linux containers side by side with Windows containers using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2. This flexibility allows organizations to modernize their applications and leverage the benefits of containerization while maintaining a secure environment.

## Improved Performance and Resilience

Windows Server 2022 brings significant performance and resilience enhancements that enable organizations to optimize their workloads and improve overall efficiency.

### Direct Storage

One of the standout features of Windows Server 2022 is Direct Storage. This technology, previously available in Windows 10 and Xbox Series X/S, now comes to the server platform. Direct Storage leverages the power of NVMe drives to significantly improve storage performance, reduce latency, and increase overall throughput. Upgrading to Windows Server 2022 will enable organizations to take full advantage of this technology and enhance their storage infrastructure.

### Resilient File System (ReFS) Improvements

Windows Server 2022 introduces several improvements to the Resilient File System (ReFS). ReFS now supports storage tiering, allowing organizations to create hybrid storage spaces that combine the performance of solid-state drives (SSDs) with the capacity of hard disk drives (HDDs). Additionally, ReFS gains support for the LBA64 addressing mode, enabling larger volume sizes and improved scalability. These enhancements make ReFS an even more reliable and efficient file system, benefiting organizations with large-scale storage requirements.

### GPU Virtualization

For organizations that leverage GPU-intensive workloads, Windows Server 2022 introduces support for GPU virtualization. This feature enables multiple virtual machines to share a single GPU, delivering increased efficiency and cost savings. Upgrading to Windows Server 2022 will allow organizations to harness the power of GPU acceleration while maintaining a flexible and scalable virtualized environment.

## Streamlined Management and Hybrid Capabilities

Windows Server 2022 provides new management and hybrid capabilities that simplify operations, enhance productivity, and support modern IT architectures.

### Windows Admin Center

Windows Admin Center is a powerful management tool that enables centralized administration of Windows Server environments. With Windows Server 2022, Microsoft has introduced new features and improvements to Windows Admin Center. These include enhanced monitoring capabilities, streamlined management of Azure resources, and deeper integration with Azure Arc. Upgrading to Windows Server 2022 will provide organizations with a more efficient and intuitive management experience, saving time and effort in day-to-day operations.

### Azure Hybrid Services

Windows Server 2022 offers enhanced integration with Azure through a range of hybrid services. These services, such as Azure Site Recovery, Azure Backup, and Azure Monitor, enable organizations to extend their on-premises workloads seamlessly to the cloud. Upgrading to Windows Server 2022 will enable organizations to leverage these hybrid services and benefit from a hybrid cloud architecture that combines the best of both on-premises and cloud environments.

## Conclusion

Upgrading from Windows Server 2019 to Windows Server 2022 brings numerous benefits, including enhanced security, improved performance, streamlined management, and hybrid capabilities. The new features and improvements offered by Windows Server 2022 empower organizations to protect their critical workloads, optimize resource utilization, and simplify operations.

While Windows Server 2019 has served organizations well, upgrading to Windows Server 2022 is a strategic move that ensures you stay at the forefront of technology and maximize the potential of your infrastructure. With its comprehensive set of features and improvements, Windows Server 2022 is a compelling choice for organizations looking to enhance their server environment and achieve greater efficiency and security.
