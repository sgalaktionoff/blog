# Introduction
Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Its syntax is simple, yet incredibly powerful, making it the go-to language for developers of all kinds. In recent years, Python has become increasingly popular in a range of fields from web development to machine learning and data science. As such, there is an ever-growing number of tools and libraries that make development with Python even easier. In this blog post, we will look at some of the best and most modern tools to make Python development easier and more efficient.

# Version Control - Git
One of the most important tools for any development project is version control. Version control, as the name implies, is a system of tracking changes within your project over time. It can help protect against accidentally overwriting or deleting code, and is also excellent for collaboration. In the Python-sphere, git is the gold standard for version control. 

Git allows developers to track changes to their code and easily revert back to previous versions. Additionally, GitHub - a web-based git repository - makes creating collaborations on projects and sharing code with others easy and intuitive. To get started with using Git and GitHub with your Python project, simply run the following commands in the terminal of your choice:

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Set up a GitHub remote
git remote add origin [GitHub repo address]

# Track the files
git add .

# Commit the files
git commit -m”Initial Commit”

# Push the files to the remote repository
git push origin master 
```

These commands will initialize a git repository in the current directory, track existing files, create an initial commit, and upload the files to GitHub, respectively. This will form the basis of your Python project's version control.

# Editor - VSCode
Once your project is under version control, it's time to get the development environment set up. A good code editor is the foundation of any programming project. Fortunately, there are lots of excellent ones to choose from. Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is quickly becoming the editor of choice for Python developers, as it comes packed with a ton of features to make development easier. 

VSCode's most popular feature is its autocompletion, as it is constantly suggesting ideas as you type. This is particularly useful when using Python, as its autocompletion for the standard library can be particularly helpful when developing an unfamiliar module. It also supports many popular frameworks such as flask and Django, as well as various linting and debugging tools. 

VSCode also has support for git and GitHub, making development with version control even more effortless. Additionally, its marketplace offers hundreds of extensions and themes which can be customized to your own tastes. No matter what your specific development environment requires, VSCode has something to offer. 

# Automation - Fabric
A key ingredient to high-quality software development is automation. Fabric is one of the most popular tools for automating Python development, and for good reason. It is an easy-to-use library that makes automating various tasks a breeze.

Common uses of Fabric include deployment and management of applications, automated testing, writing CLI tools, and more. Fabric can be used to automate task that would otherwise take up a lot of manual effort. Its core language is Python, so it is extremely easy for existing developers to pick up, while still being powerful and efficient. 

In addition, Fabric can be used to take control of remote machines over SSH. This can be used, for example, to configure servers, deploy applications, and roll out updates with a few simple commands. With the help of Fabric, automating these processes is made much easier. 

# Conclusion
 Python is a powerful language on its own, but modern tools such as Git, VSCode, and Fabric can further simplify and expedite the development process. By utilizing these tools, developers can take full advantage of Python's features and create powerful applications. This blog post has outlined some of the most popular and useful tools to make Python development easier and more efficient. Whether you are new to Python or an experienced developer, these tools can drastically improve your workflow.
